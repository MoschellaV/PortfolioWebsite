## ðŸ“„ About My Portfolio
I wanted my portfolio website to provide an interactive and immersive experience for visitors. I also liked the kinda minimalistic look using mainly black and white, but at the same time I wanted to seperate myself from the typical portfolio website. So I decided to use neutral tones, custom components, and custom 3D models that I created to achieve the look I wanted. 
<br/>

### ðŸš€ Features

- **Custom 3D models:** Users can interact with custom 3D models.
- **Responsive:** Responsive design that works seamlessly across devices and screen sizes.
- **Transitions:** Smooth transitions and animations to keep users engaged and encourage them to explore the entire site.
- **Optimization:** Optimized loading times for speed and performance (considering the size of the 3D models it's optimized lol).
- **Contact form:** Contact form is also provided if you want to get in touch with me.
- **SEO:** The site is has an SEO-friendly structure.
<br/>

### ðŸ’» Tech Used
My site uses this tech:

- [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) Used to ensure swift server-side rendering of the website, resulting in enhanced performance.
- [**Spline**](https://spline.design/) Utilized to create and design 3D models.
- [**Material UI**](https://mui.com/) UI library used for styling, building custom components, and enhancing the the user interface.
